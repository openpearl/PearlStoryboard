Please do not change the contents of this folder. Anything within this folder will be overwritten by the actual scss files within the components folder of the app itself. This helps keep the code tied together and compartmentalized.

However, this folder is a good place to flatten all of our resources for easy reference. It's meant to be a storage and not the home of the actual scss files.
